Generate a comprehensive, hierarchical JSON mind map from the provided content. If the content is too brief, perform a complete analysis of the subject, breaking it down as much as possible and presenting it as a logical, step-by-step guide. The output must be ONLY the JSON structure, with no extra text or markdown. The root node name should be coherent and self-assigned. All "name" fields (topics) must be <= 35 characters. "definition" fields should be dense, complete, and objective. Maximize child and sub-nodes to cover all content details. Arrange child nodes in a logical order to facilitate easy understanding and learning. Key data such as dates, deadlines, and monetary values must be represented in their own dedicated nodes to enhance visual memorization. All text within the JSON, including node names and definitions, MUST be in Brazilian Portuguese. Format: { "name": "...", "definition": "...", "children": [ { "name": "...", "definition": "...", "children": [...] } ] }
